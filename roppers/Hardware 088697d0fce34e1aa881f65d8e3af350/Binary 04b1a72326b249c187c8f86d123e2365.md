## Why Binary

Because in binary it’s only two like ON OFF, high and low, 0 and 1.

### Bits, nibble and bytes

|| –|–|– **length** | **Name** | **Example** 1 | Bits | 0 4 | Nibble | 0101 8 | Byte | 10111010

### Complement (NOT)

Representing sign - **tilde(~)** **NOT** turns every 1 in 0 and every 0 becomes 1.

NOT 1001 = 0110

### OR

Representing sign - ( *pipe* **|**) **OR** takes two numbers and produces the union of them.

0 OR 0 = 0 0 OR 1 = 1 1 OR 1 = 1 1 OR 0 = 1

EX – 110011 OR 100111 = 110111

### AND

Representing sign - *ampersand* **&**

**AND** takes two numbers and produces conjunction of them.

0 AND 0 = 0 0 AND 1 = 0 1 AND 0 = 0 1 AND 1 = 1

EX – 110011 AND 101111 = 100011

### XOR

Representing sign - *caret* **^** **XOR** is exclusive-XOR. >It only produces 1 when it’s one side’s bit is 1.

0 XOR 0 = 0 0 XOR 1 = 1 1 XOR 0 = 1 1 XOR 1 = 0

EX – 1101 XOR 0110 = 1011

### Binary in Programming

At their very lowest-level binary is what that drives electronic devices.

### Representing Binary values in Program

In Arduino or most programming languages a binary number can be represented by a **0b** preceding the binary number. Without **0b** the number will be just a decimal number.

### HEXADECIMAL

xxd is able to convert file into its hexadecimal representation.

### PNG file signature

PNG file signature

The first eight bytes of a PNG file always contain the following (decimal) values:

```
     137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10
```

This signature indicates that the remainder of the file contains a single PNG image, consisting of a series of chunks beginning with an IHDR chunk and ending with an IEND chunk.

(decimal) 137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10 (hexadecimal) 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0 (ASCII C notation) \211 P N G \032
